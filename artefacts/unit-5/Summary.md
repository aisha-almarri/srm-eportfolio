# Unit 5: Risk Management Standards and Frameworks

## Learning Focus: Implementing Structured Risk Processes
This unit shifted the focus from theoretical concepts to practical frameworks for implementing risk management.

## Key Reading Synthesis
- **Aven & Thekdi (Ch. 8) & Barafort et al. (2019):** The readings converged on the importance of a continuous, integrated risk management process. Barafort's ISO 31000-based assessment model was particularly insightful, providing a clear maturity model for evaluating how well an IT organisation embeds risk management into its lifecycle.
- **Sutton (Appendix G) & Kirvan (2023):** These provided a crucial bridge between the high-level theory of ISO 31000 and the specific, actionable controls required for cybersecurity.

## Critical Analysis and Application
The main insight from this unit is that a framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The choice depends on the organisation's industry, regulatory environment, and maturity. For enterprise IT management, this means selecting and adapting frameworks to fit specific organizational contexts while maintaining compliance with standards like ISO 31000.
