# Unit 3: Threat Modeling Methodologies

## Learning Focus: Systematic Threat Identification
This unit focused on structured approaches to identifying and analyzing security threats.

## Key Reading Synthesis
- **Threat Modeling Manifesto (2020):** Established core principles for effective threat modeling
- **Shevchenko et al.:** Provided comprehensive summary of available methodologies
- **Aven Chapter 4:** Connected threat modeling to broader risk science context

## Methodology Understanding
I studied multiple threat modeling approaches including STRIDE, PASTA, and Trike. The STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) provided a systematic framework for analyzing system components.

## Practical Application
Created conceptual threat models for web applications, identifying key attack vectors and prioritizing mitigation strategies based on potential impact.
