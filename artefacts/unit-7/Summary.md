# Unit 7: Quantitative Risk Analysis & Decision-Making

## Learning Focus: Moving Beyond Qualitative Guesses
This unit introduced formal methods for quantifying risk and supporting complex decisions.

## Key Reading Synthesis
- **Asadabadi et al. (2019):** Critical review of AHP/ANP methods, highlighting both utility and limitations in multi-criteria decision making
- **Metropolis (1987):** Historical context of Monte Carlo methods for modeling uncertainty
- **Fraser & Simkins (Ch. 22):** Enterprise applications of quantitative risk analysis

## Methodological Understanding
Studied complementary quantitative approaches:
- **AHP/ANP:** For structured multi-criteria decision making
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** For modeling complex systems with uncertainty
- **Bayesian Networks:** For probabilistic risk assessment

## Professional Application
Recognized that quantitative methods provide more rigorous foundation for risk decisions compared to purely qualitative approaches, though requiring appropriate expertise and data.
