# Unit 1: Core Concepts of Risk

## Summary of Learning
This unit introduced the foundational concepts of risk. Aven & Thekdi (2025) define risk as "the effect of uncertainty on objectives," which moved me away from simply thinking of risk as 'chance of something bad happening.' I contrasted this with the more traditional, quantitative approach critiqued by Hubbard (2020), who argues that many risk management practices are fundamentally broken due to poor measurement.

## Key Insights:
1. **Risk vs. Uncertainty:** I now understand that risk is not just about known probabilities but also about uncertainty and the potential for surprise.
2. **Qualitative vs. Quantitative:** The NIST SP 800-30 guide provides a structured, qualitative approach, while Hubbard advocates for more rigorous quantification. This tension is a key theme I will follow.
3. **Human Element:** The Hancock et al. (2024) reading on maritime rights highlighted that risk models can have real-world ethical consequences if they ignore human factors.

## Application to Practice:
I started a simple risk register for a personal project using a template from the NIST guide, categorising risks based on likelihood and impact. This was my first practical step in applying risk theory.
