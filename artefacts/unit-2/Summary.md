# Unit 2: Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) & Frameworks

## Learning Focus: Holistic Risk Management Approaches
This unit explored enterprise-wide risk management frameworks and their application in IT contexts.

## Key Reading Synthesis
- **AIRMIC (2010):** Provided comprehensive understanding of structured ERM approaches and ISO 31000 requirements
- **Open FAIRâ„¢ Tool:** Demonstrated practical risk analysis methodology implementation
- **Renn et al. (2021):** Explored digitalisation risks from sustainable development perspective

## Conceptual Application
I analyzed how ERM provides a top-down, holistic view of risk, unlike siloed approaches. The Open FAIR methodology offered a structured way to quantify risk factors, though I recognized its complexity for initial implementations.

## Professional Insight
The transition from technical risk management to enterprise-wide strategic risk consideration represents a significant maturity progression for IT organizations.
