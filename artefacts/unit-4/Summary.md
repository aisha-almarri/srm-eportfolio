# Unit 4: Secure System Engineering

## Learning Focus: Security by Design Principles
This unit emphasized integrating security throughout the system development lifecycle.

## Key Reading Synthesis
- **Ross (NIST):** Comprehensive guidelines for multidisciplinary security engineering
- **Salter et al. (1998):** Foundational work on secure system engineering methodology
- **GitHub Threat Model Cookbook:** Practical implementation guidance

## Core Principles Identified
1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimizing access rights to essential only
2. **Defense in Depth:** Layered security controls
3. **Fail Securely:** Systems should default to secure state during failures
4. **Separation of Duties:** Critical actions requiring multiple approvals

## Professional Application
I developed security design principles for cloud applications, ensuring security considerations are integrated from initial architecture through deployment and maintenance.
