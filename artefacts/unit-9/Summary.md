# Unit 9: Ensuring Service Availability

## Learning Focus: Quantifying and Managing Availability Risks
This unit narrowed the focus to a key security objective: Availability, exploring how to formally model and assess system resilience.

## Key Reading Synthesis
- **Andrade (2017):** Masterclass in applied risk assessment through DRaaS modeling
- **Popov et al. (2022):** General risk assessment principles contextualizing availability risks

## Core Concepts Mastered
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Maximum acceptable downtime
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Availability Metrics:** Formal approaches to quantifying system resilience

## Professional Application
Understood that availability requirements must be explicitly stated in RTO/RPO terms before meaningful risk assessment can occur. This represents a maturation from vague availability goals to precise service level objectives.
