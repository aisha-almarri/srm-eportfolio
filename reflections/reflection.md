# Reflective Analysis: The Evolution of a Risk Management Perspective

## 1. Evaluation of Final Project (Unit 11) vs. Status Document (Unit 6)

The journey from the Unit 6 Team Status Document to the Unit 11 Individual Executive Summary represents a profound evolution in my understanding and application of security and risk management. The two documents, while addressing the same client, are products of different learning stages and demonstrate a marked shift from qualitative awareness to quantitative, strategic synthesis.

The Unit 6 Status Document was our team's first foray into structured risk assessment. Its primary value was in the systematic identification of risks. Using the NIST SP 800-30 framework, we successfully catalogued the obvious threats to Pampered Pets' current and future states. However, the analysis was inherently qualitative and descriptive. Risks were labelled "High, Medium, Low" based on collective judgement. Our recommendations, such as "implement cybersecurity training" or "use cloud backups," were standard best practices but lacked a rigorous justification rooted in probabilistic analysis or specific financial impact. It was a competent hazard list, but not yet a sophisticated risk management tool. The collaboration was crucial here, as it pooled our nascent knowledge to create a broad, if shallow, risk landscape.

In stark contrast, the Unit 11 Executive Summary demanded a deeper, more analytical approach. This was not about listing risks, but about quantifying and modelling them to inform a high-stakes investment decision. The shift in methodology from NIST SP 800-30 to a blend of STRIDE, DREAD, and Monte Carlo simulation was critical. This transition moved the analysis from "what could go wrong?" to "how likely is it to go wrong, what is the precise impact, and what is the aggregated probability of failure?" Calculating a 52% probability of a quality incident was a far more powerful and alarming insight for an executive than simply stating "quality risks are high."

Furthermore, the Unit 11 project required a shift from generic mitigations to a prioritised, costed investment plan. The Status Document suggested solutions; the Executive Summary built a business case for them, complete with annual costs, risk reduction percentages, and a clear ROI in terms of risk mitigation. The development of a detailed Disaster Recovery plan with specific RTO/RPO targets and a sophisticated vendor lock-in analysis demonstrated an ability to think several steps ahead, anticipating operational and strategic challenges that were beyond the scope of our initial team assessment.

In essence, the Status Document was a diagnostic report, while the Executive Summary was a strategic prescription. The former identified the illness; the latter proposed a detailed, costed treatment plan with a clear prognosis.

## 2. Reflection on the Security and Risk Management Process

My perception of the Security and Risk Management (SRM) process has been fundamentally reshaped through this module. I entered with a somewhat technical view, seeing SRM as a series of controls to implement. I now understand it as a continuous, holistic, and strategic discipline that is integral to business decision-making.

The core textbook by Aven & Thekdi (2025) was instrumental in this shift, particularly its emphasis on risk as "the effect of uncertainty on objectives." This definition forced me to look beyond IT systems to business goals. The potential loss of HRH the King as a client is not just a reputational risk; it is a direct threat to the business's revenue and strategic positioning. The process is not linear but cyclical. The Unit 11 project did not end with the implementation of controls; it included a plan for continuous testing, auditing, and monitoring, reflecting the "Check-Act" cycle of ISO 31000 which we studied in Unit 5.

I also gained a critical appreciation for the hierarchy of methodologies. Simple qualitative matrices (Unit 6) are excellent for communication and initial prioritisation. However, for complex, high-value decisions, quantitative approaches (Unit 11) are indispensable for cutting through ambiguity and providing a evidence-based foundation for investment. The ability to select the right tool for the right context is a key skill I have developed.

## 3. My Contributions to Team Activities (Unit 6)

In the Unit 6 team project, my designated role was Member 3, responsible for Recommendations and Summary. This placed me in a crucial synthesising position at the end of the team workflow.

My primary contribution was to analyse and integrate the work of Members 1 and 2. I created a comparative analysis table that contrasted the risk profiles of the status quo versus digitalisation, which became the visual cornerstone of our recommendation. I then answered the three key business questions by weaving together their findings. For instance, I used Member 1's identification of "weak WiFi" and "no online presence" to build the case for the risk of losing customers, and Member 2's analysis of cyber threats to qualify the growth opportunity of an online presence.

I also took the initiative to design the phased implementation roadmap. This demonstrated an understanding that risk management is not just about planning but also about execution. By proposing a timeline that started with securing the existing infrastructure before launching new digital services, I embedded a risk-aware approach into the very plan for change.

My role required me to be the "connector," ensuring our final report was a cohesive narrative, not just a collection of individual parts. I provided feedback on the risk tables to ensure consistency and championed the use of the NIST framework throughout to strengthen our report's credibility.

## 4. My Experience as a Development Team Member

The experience of working as part of a "development team" simulating a professional consultancy was immensely valuable. It mirrored real-world dynamics where specialists must collaborate to produce a unified deliverable.

A key challenge was integrating different perspectives and working styles. We had to establish a common language around risk concepts to ensure we were all assessing likelihood and impact on the same scale. Our initial meetings were essential for aligning on the scope and methodology, preventing divergent work streams later on.

The peer review process at the end of Unit 6 introduced a layer of professional accountability. It reinforced that contributions are not just about completing tasks, but about the quality, timeliness, and collaborative spirit with which they are delivered. This experience taught me that effective collaboration in a knowledge-based team is as much about clear communication and mutual respect as it is about technical competence.

## 5. Impact on Professional and Personal Development

Professionally, this module has equipped me with a framework and a vocabulary I can immediately apply in my career. Whether I pursue a role directly in risk management or in a broader IT management capacity, I now possess the ability to:

- Structure a risk assessment using established frameworks.
- Justify security investments using quantitative and business-focused language.
- Design resilient architectures with clear DR/BCP requirements.
- Understand and articulate compliance obligations like GDPR.

The experience of writing the Unit 11 Executive Summary, in particular, has honed my ability to communicate complex, technical risks to a non-technical, executive audience—a skill of inestimable value.

Personally, this module has cultivated a more critical and structured mindset. I find myself automatically thinking in terms of "What are the assumptions here?", "What could cause this to fail?", and "How would we measure the impact?". The concepts of probability and uncertainty, so central to Aven & Thekdi's work, have changed how I approach problems beyond an academic context. I am more comfortable with ambiguity and more rigorous in my decision-making.

## Conclusion

This module has transformed my view of risk from a negative concept to be avoided into a positive dimension of business to be managed and leveraged. The progression from the collaborative, foundational Status Document to the individual, sophisticated Executive Summary perfectly encapsulates my journey from a student of risk to a budding practitioner.
